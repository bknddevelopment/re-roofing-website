---

2. Click "Run All Tests" to see live results
3. Manually test each interactive feature
4. Fix issues and re-test

### Monitoring:

## SUMMARY

**Overall Status**: ⚠ **INCOMPLETE**

The R&E Roofing site has solid foundation code with:
- ✓ Complete JavaScript functionality
- ✓ Professional CSS styling
- ✓ Good SEO structure
- ✓ Interactive features coded properly

However, the site is **not functional** because:
- ✗ Only 1 of 8 pages exists
- ✗ All navigation links broken
- ✗ Multi-page conversion incomplete
- ✗ Key sections (calculator, FAQ, reviews) not accessible

**Recommendation**: Either complete the multi-page implementation OR revert to single-page design.
