# SEO Site Health Audit - Phase 2 (Town-Specific Landing Pages)
**R&E Roofing - Essex County, NJ**
**Audit Date:** September 30, 2025
**Auditor:** SEO Site Health Specialist
**Contact:** (667) 204-1609

---

## Executive Summary

**AUDIT STATUS: PHASE 2 NOT IMPLEMENTED**

**Verdict:** BLOCK - Phase 2 cannot proceed to verification as the required town-specific landing pages have not been created.

**Summary:** The SEO Strategy document (SEO_STRATEGY.md) defines Phase 2 as the creation of 10 Tier 1 town-specific landing pages for Essex County towns. After comprehensive codebase examination, zero (0) town-specific pages have been implemented. The homepage (index.html) contains an "Areas We Serve" section with 22 town names, but these link to placeholder anchors (#) rather than dedicated landing pages.

**Required Action:** Frontend-developer must complete Phase 2 implementation before this audit can proceed.

## Audit Findings

### 1. Page Existence Check: FAIL

**Status:** 0 of 10 required pages exist

**Files Found:**
```
/index.html
/services.html
/calculator.html
/reviews.html
/faq.html
/about.html
/quote.html
/blog.html
```

**Files NOT Found:**
- No `/roofing-newark-nj.html` or `/roofing-newark-nj/index.html`
- No `/roofing-montclair-nj.html` or `/roofing-montclair-nj/index.html`
- No town-specific directory structure
- No town-specific HTML files with any naming convention

**Evidence:**
```bash
# Glob search for town-specific files: 0 results
# Glob search for "town" in filenames: 0 results
# Glob search for "location" in filenames: 0 results
```

### 2. Homepage Internal Linking Check: INCOMPLETE

**Location:** `/index.html` lines 342-377 (Areas We Serve section)

**Current Implementation:**
```html
<section class="areas-served">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="section-header">
            <h2>Proudly Serving All of Essex County, NJ</h2>
            <p>Professional roofing, siding, and gutter services for homeowners and businesses across all 22 Essex County towns</p>
        </div>
        <div class="areas-grid">
            <a href="#" class="area-link">Newark</a>
            <a href="#" class="area-link">East Orange</a>
            <a href="#" class="area-link">Irvington</a>
            <!-- ... 19 more towns ... -->
        </div>
    </div>
</section>
```

**Issues:**
- All 22 town links point to `#` (empty anchor)
- No actual destination pages exist
- Users clicking these links will experience dead ends
- Search engines cannot crawl town-specific content
- No link equity flows to town pages

**Required Fix:**
```html
<a href="roofing-newark-nj.html" class="area-link">Newark</a>
<a href="roofing-montclair-nj.html" class="area-link">Montclair</a>
<!-- etc. -->
```

### 3. Sitemap Check: INCOMPLETE

**File:** `/sitemap.xml`

**Current Sitemap Contents:**
```xml

        <lastmod>2024-09-19</lastmod>

        <changefreq>monthly</changefreq>
        <priority>0.8</priority>
    </url>
    <!-- Additional pages listed -->
</urlset>
```

**Issues:**
- No town-specific pages listed in sitemap
- Cannot submit non-existent pages to Google
- Search engines unaware of town-specific content

**Required Addition (once pages exist):**
```xml
<url>
    <loc>https://reroofing.com/roofing-newark-nj.html</loc>
    <lastmod>2025-09-30</lastmod>
    <changefreq>monthly</changefreq>
    <priority>0.9</priority>

<!-- Repeat for all 10 town pages -->
```

## Appendix B: Content Differentiation Examples

### Example: How to Write Unique Content

**DON'T DO THIS (Generic Template):**
```
We provide professional roofing services in [TOWN].
Our team has many years of experience.
We offer free estimates.
Call us today!
```

**DO THIS (Unique, Local Content):**

**Newark Version:**
```
As Newark's trusted roofing contractor since 1998, we understand
the unique challenges of maintaining roofs in this densely populated
urban environment. From the historic brownstones of Forest Hill to
the multi-family properties in the Ironbound, we've helped thousands
of Newark property owners protect their investments.

Newark's position near the coast means your roof faces constant
exposure to salt air, humidity, and severe weather moving up from
the Atlantic. Our team specializes in roofing solutions designed
specifically for Newark's urban microclimate...
```

**Montclair Version:**
```
Montclair's reputation for architectural excellence demands a roofing
contractor who understands historic preservation and aesthetic
integrity. For over two decades, we've been the trusted choice for
Upper Montclair's Victorian estates and the charming Arts & Crafts
homes of the South End.

Many of Montclair's homes are over 100 years old, requiring specialized
roofing techniques that honor the original craftsmanship while
incorporating modern weatherproofing technology. Whether you own
a designated historic property or a contemporary home in the
Watchung Plaza area...
```

**Key Differences:**
- Different neighborhoods mentioned
- Different architectural styles
- Different climate/location factors
- Different community characteristics
- Different historical context
