## RECOMMENDED IMMEDIATE FIXES (DEPLOYMENT BLOCKERS)

### Priority 1: GDPR Compliance (CRITICAL)

**1. Create Privacy Policy Page**

File: `/privacy-policy.html`

Required Sections:
- Business identity and contact information
- Types of personal data collected (name, email, phone, address)
- Lawful basis for processing (Consent under Article 6(1)(a))
- Purposes of processing (Quote requests, service inquiries)
- Data retention period (e.g., "90 days or until request fulfilled")
- Data subject rights (Access, rectification, erasure, portability, restriction, objection)
- Right to withdraw consent
- Right to lodge complaint with supervisory authority
- Whether data is shared with third parties (if applicable)
- Contact information for data protection inquiries

**2. Add Privacy Policy Links**

Locations to update (ALL 92 files):
```html
<!-- In footer section (line ~430) -->
<div class="footer-bottom">
    <p>&copy; 2024 R&E Roofing. All rights reserved. | Serving Essex County, NJ
    | <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>
    | <a href="terms-of-service.html">Terms of Service</a></p>
</div>
```

**3. Add Consent Checkbox to Forms**

Locations: All contact forms (modal and `/quote.html`)

```html
<!-- Add before submit button (line ~119 in modal, line ~256 in quote.html) -->
<div class="form-group">
    <label class="checkbox-label">
        <input type="checkbox" id="privacy-consent" name="privacy-consent" required>
        I consent to R&E Roofing collecting and processing my personal data
        as described in the <a href="privacy-policy.html" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.
        I understand I can withdraw consent at any time.*
    </label>
</div>
```

**4. Add Privacy Notice at Point of Collection**

Add below form title (line ~68 in modal):

```html
<p class="privacy-notice">
    We collect your personal information to provide you with roofing quotes and services.
    Your data will be processed in accordance with our
    <a href="privacy-policy.html" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.
    You have the right to access, correct, or delete your data at any time.
</p>
```

---

### Priority 2: Cookie Consent (CRITICAL)

**Option A: Remove Third-Party Resources (FASTEST)**

Replace Google Fonts and Font Awesome with self-hosted versions:

1. Download fonts locally
2. Host Font Awesome locally
3. Remove all external CDN links
4. Eliminates cookie issue entirely

**Option B: Implement Cookie Consent Banner**

Use free CMP like:
- Cookiebot (free tier)
- OneTrust (requires license)
- Custom banner with localStorage

Example minimal compliant banner:

```html
<!-- Add before closing </body> tag -->
<div id="cookieConsent" class="cookie-banner">
    <p>We use cookies from third-party services (Google Fonts, Font Awesome CDN) to enhance functionality.
    <a href="privacy-policy.html#cookies">Learn more</a></p>
    <button onclick="acceptCookies()">Accept</button>
    <button onclick="declineCookies()">Decline</button>
</div>

<script>
function acceptCookies() {
    localStorage.setItem('cookieConsent', 'accepted');
    document.getElementById('cookieConsent').style.display = 'none';
    loadExternalResources();
}

function declineCookies() {
    localStorage.setItem('cookieConsent', 'declined');
    document.getElementById('cookieConsent').style.display = 'none';
    // Use fallback local fonts
}

// Check consent on page load
if (!localStorage.getItem('cookieConsent')) {
    document.getElementById('cookieConsent').style.display = 'block';
} else if (localStorage.getItem('cookieConsent') === 'accepted') {
    loadExternalResources();
}
</script>
```

**Recommendation:** Option A (self-host) is faster and eliminates compliance burden.

---

### Priority 3: Schema Markup Integrity (MODERATE)

**File:** `/index.html` (lines 81-85)

**REMOVE IMMEDIATELY:**
```json
"aggregateRating": {
    "@type": "AggregateRating",
    "ratingValue": "4.9",
    "reviewCount": "127"
}
```

**Replace with:**
```json
// Remove entire aggregateRating block OR
// Replace with real Google Business Profile review data
```

**Legal Reason:** False advertising, FTC Endorsement Guide violations, consumer fraud.

---

### Priority 4: Accessibility Fixes (MODERATE)

**1. Add Skip Navigation Link**

Add after opening `<body>` tag (line 133):

```html
<a href="#main-content" class="skip-link">Skip to main content</a>

<style>
.skip-link {
    position: absolute;
    top: -40px;
    left: 0;
    background: #000;
    color: #fff;
    padding: 8px;
    z-index: 100;
}
.skip-link:focus {
    top: 0;
}
</style>
```

**2. Fix Form Label Association**

File: `/quote.html` and modal (lines 113-117)

**Current (WRONG):**
```html
<label><input type="radio" name="contact-method" value="phone" checked> Phone</label>
```

**Fixed:**
```html
<input type="radio" id="contact-phone" name="contact-method" value="phone" checked>
<label for="contact-phone">Phone</label>
```

**3. Add ARIA Live Region for Form Errors**

File: `/js/main.js` (line ~160)

```javascript
// Create error container with ARIA
const errorContainer = document.createElement('div');
errorContainer.setAttribute('aria-live', 'polite');
errorContainer.setAttribute('aria-atomic', 'true');
errorContainer.className = 'error-message';
```

---

### Priority 5: Business Disclosures (LOW)

**1. Add Contractor License Number**

Update footer (line 393 in all files):

```html
<p class="footer-license">
    Licensed & Insured in New Jersey<br>
    HIC Registration #: [INSERT ACTUAL LICENSE NUMBER]
</p>
```

**2. Update Schema Business Address**

File: All town pages + index.html (line 44)

**Replace:**
```json
"streetAddress": "Business Address",
```

**With real address OR service-area designation:**
```json
"@type": "PostalAddress",
"addressLocality": "Newark",
"addressRegion": "NJ",
"postalCode": "07102",
"addressCountry": "US"
// Remove streetAddress if service-area business
```
