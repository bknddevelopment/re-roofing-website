2. Add Blog schema to blog.html (HIGH)
3. Add BlogPosting schema to each post (HIGH)
4. Update sitemap.xml with blog posts (HIGH)
5. Implement internal linking from service/town pages (MEDIUM)

**Estimated Time to Complete:**

## RECOMMENDATION

The blog.html update is a positive step forward and shows good progress. However, **Phase 4 cannot be considered complete** until all 12 blog post HTML files are created with proper content, schema markup, and internal linking.

**Immediate next action**: Invoke blog-trends-creator agent to generate all 12 blog post HTML files based on the titles and topics already defined in blog.html.
