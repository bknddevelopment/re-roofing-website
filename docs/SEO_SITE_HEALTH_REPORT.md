## 2. SEO WARNINGS (FIX BEFORE LAUNCH)

### 2.1 Title Tags Over 60 Characters (85 Pages)

**Issue:** Google typically displays 50-60 characters of title tags in search results. Titles exceeding this limit get truncated with "..." which reduces click-through rates.

**Impact:** Moderate - Affects SERP appearance and CTR

**Affected Pages:** 85 out of 91 pages

**Examples:**
```
❌ Current: "Gutter Repair & Cleaning in Belleville, NJ | R&E Roofing | Licensed & Insured" (77 chars)
✓ Optimal: "Gutter Repair Belleville NJ | R&E Roofing | Free Quote" (57 chars)

❌ Current: "New Roof Installation in West Orange, NJ | R&E Roofing | Licensed & Insured" (75 chars)
✓ Optimal: "New Roof Installation West Orange NJ | R&E Roofing" (52 chars)

❌ Current: "Roofing Services in Essex County, NJ - R&E Roofing | Siding & Gutters" (69 chars)
✓ Optimal: "Essex County Roofing Services NJ | R&E Roofing" (48 chars)
```

**Recommended Title Format:**
```html
<!-- Pattern: {Service} {Town} NJ | R&E Roofing | {CTA} -->
<!-- Max 60 characters -->

Examples:
<title>Roof Repair Newark NJ | R&E Roofing | Free Estimate</title> (57 chars)
<title>Gutter Install Montclair NJ | R&E Roofing | Call Now</title> (60 chars)
<title>Siding Repair Bloomfield NJ | R&E Roofing | Licensed</title> (59 chars)
```

**Fix Strategy:**
1. Remove "in" preposition: "Roof Repair Newark NJ" vs "Roof Repair in Newark, NJ"
2. Shorten "Installation" to "Install" where needed
3. Remove "Licensed & Insured" (move to description)
4. Use shorter CTAs: "Free Quote" vs "Licensed & Insured"
5. Remove punctuation: "Newark NJ" vs "Newark, NJ"

**Files Requiring Title Optimization:** (Top Priority - 20 Files with Longest Titles)

```

---

### 2.2 Meta Descriptions Over 160 Characters (91 Pages)

**Issue:** Google displays approximately 155-160 characters of meta descriptions. Longer descriptions get truncated, potentially cutting off key selling points or calls-to-action.

**Impact:** High - Directly affects click-through rate from search results

**Affected Pages:** ALL 91 pages

**Current Examples:**
```
❌ roofing-newark-nj.html: 165 chars
"Professional roofing services in Newark, NJ. 25+ years serving Essex County with roof repair, replacement, siding & gutters. Licensed & insured. Call (667) 204-1609."

❌ gutter-installation-newark-nj.html: 169 chars
"Expert gutter installation services in Newark, NJ. 25+ years serving Essex County. Licensed & insured. Free estimates. Emergency services available. Call (667) 204-1609."

❌ quote.html: 206 chars (SEVERELY OVER)
"Get your free roofing quote from R&E Roofing. Expert estimates for roof repair, replacement, siding & gutters throughout Essex County, NJ. Online calculator and instant quote form available. Licensed & insured contractor."
```

**Recommended Meta Description Format:**
```html
<!-- Max 155 characters for optimal display -->
<!-- Include: Location + Service + Key Benefit + CTA -->

<!-- Town Landing Pages -->
<meta name="description" content="Expert roofing services in Newark NJ. Licensed contractor with 25+ years experience. Free estimates. Call (667) 204-1609 today.">
<!-- Length: 139 characters ✓ -->

<!-- Service × Location Pages -->
<meta name="description" content="Professional roof repair in Montclair NJ. Fast response, licensed contractor. Free estimates. Call R&E Roofing (667) 204-1609.">
<!-- Length: 129 characters ✓ -->

<!-- Gutter Services (Shorter) -->
<meta name="description" content="Gutter installation & repair in Bloomfield NJ. Quality work, fair pricing. Licensed contractor. Call (667) 204-1609.">
<!-- Length: 118 characters ✓ -->
```

**Optimization Formula:**
```
[Service Type] in [Town] NJ. [Key Benefit]. [Credentials]. [CTA with Phone].

Examples:
- Roof repair in Newark NJ. Fast emergency service, 25+ years experience. Licensed & insured. Call (667) 204-1609 now.
- Gutter cleaning in Montclair NJ. Prevent water damage. Expert team. Free estimate at (667) 204-1609.
- Siding installation in Bloomfield NJ. Premium materials, professional crew. Licensed. Call (667) 204-1609.

### 2.3 Deprecated Meta Keywords Tag (91 Pages)

**Issue:** The `<meta name="keywords">` tag has been officially deprecated by Google since 2009 and is ignored by all major search engines. Its presence adds unnecessary code bloat and may signal outdated SEO practices.

**Impact:** Low - Does not harm rankings but serves no purpose

**Affected Pages:** ALL 91 pages contain meta keywords

**Example:**
```html
<!-- REMOVE THIS TAG FROM ALL PAGES -->
<meta name="keywords" content="roof-repair newark, newark roof-repair, roof-repair newark nj, roof-repair contractor newark, emergency roof-repair newark">
```

**Issue in Keywords Content:**
Notice the hyphenated keywords like "roof-repair" and "new-roof-installation" - these appear to be generated from filename patterns rather than natural keyword research. This further confirms these are auto-generated and should be removed.

**Fix:**
```bash
# Remove meta keywords from all HTML files
for file in *.html; do
    if [[ "$file" != *"test"* ]] && [[ "$file" != *"optimized"* ]]; then
        sed -i.bak '/<meta name="keywords"/d' "$file"
        rm -f "$file.bak"
    fi
done
```

**Manual Alternative:**
Delete lines 10-11 from each HTML file that contain:
```html
    <meta name="keywords" content="...">
```

**Recommendation:** Remove immediately. This is a quick win that cleans up code and removes 91 unnecessary lines across the site.

---

### 2.4 Sitemap Missing 3 Pages

**Issue:** Three town landing pages exist but are not included in `sitemap.xml`, meaning Google may not discover and index them.

**Impact:** High - These pages will have delayed or no indexing

**Missing Pages:**
```
1. /Users/charwinvanryckdegroot/Github/re-roofing-website/roofing-millburn-nj.html
2. /Users/charwinvanryckdegroot/Github/re-roofing-website/roofing-orange-nj.html
3. /Users/charwinvanryckdegroot/Github/re-roofing-website/roofing-verona-nj.html
```

**Fix:** Add these entries to `sitemap.xml` after line 144 (after roofing-maplewood-nj.html):

```xml
<!-- ADD THESE ENTRIES TO SITEMAP.XML -->

    <url>
        <loc>https://www.reroofing.com/roofing-millburn-nj.html</loc>
        <lastmod>2025-10-02</lastmod>
        <changefreq>monthly</changefreq>
        <priority>0.8</priority>
    </url>

    <url>
        <loc>https://www.reroofing.com/roofing-orange-nj.html</loc>
        <lastmod>2025-10-02</lastmod>
        <changefreq>monthly</changefreq>
        <priority>0.8</priority>
    </url>

    <url>
        <loc>https://www.reroofing.com/roofing-verona-nj.html</loc>
        <lastmod>2025-10-02</lastmod>
        <changefreq>monthly</changefreq>
        <priority>0.8</priority>
    </url>
```

**Location in sitemap.xml:** Insert after line 144 (between roofing-maplewood-nj.html and the "Roof Repair Service Pages" comment)
