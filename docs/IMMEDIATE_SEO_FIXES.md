# IMMEDIATE SEO FIXES
**Critical Patches for Production Deployment**

---

## FIX 1: ADD MISSING PAGES TO SITEMAP.XML

**Priority:** CRITICAL (Do before deployment)
**Time Required:** 5 minutes
**Impact:** Prevents 3 pages from being indexed by Google

### Location
File: `/Users/charwinvanryckdegroot/Github/re-roofing-website/sitemap.xml`
Insert after line 144 (after the roofing-maplewood-nj.html entry)

### Patch
```xml
    <!-- ADD THESE THREE ENTRIES -->

    <url>
        <loc>https://www.reroofing.com/roofing-millburn-nj.html</loc>
        <lastmod>2025-10-02</lastmod>
        <changefreq>monthly</changefreq>
        <priority>0.8</priority>
    </url>

    <url>
        <loc>https://www.reroofing.com/roofing-orange-nj.html</loc>
        <lastmod>2025-10-02</lastmod>
        <changefreq>monthly</changefreq>
        <priority>0.8</priority>
    </url>

    <url>
        <loc>https://www.reroofing.com/roofing-verona-nj.html</loc>
        <lastmod>2025-10-02</lastmod>
        <changefreq>monthly</changefreq>
        <priority>0.8</priority>
    </url>
```

### Verification
After adding, verify sitemap has 92 `<url>` entries instead of 89:
```bash
grep -c "<loc>" sitemap.xml
# Should output: 92
```

---

## FIX 2: REMOVE DEPRECATED META KEYWORDS TAG

**Priority:** HIGH (Week 1 post-launch)
**Time Required:** 30 minutes (automated) or 2-3 hours (manual)
**Impact:** Code cleanup, removes 91 unnecessary lines

### Automated Fix (Recommended)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Run from project root directory

for file in *.html; do
    # Skip test files
    if [[ "$file" == *"test"* ]] || [[ "$file" == *"optimized"* ]]; then
        continue
    fi

    # Remove meta keywords line
    grep -v '<meta name="keywords"' "$file" > "${file}.tmp"
    mv "${file}.tmp" "$file"

    echo "Removed keywords from: $file"
done

echo "✓ Complete: Removed meta keywords from 91 files"
```

Save as `remove-keywords.sh`, then run:
```bash
chmod +x remove-keywords.sh
./remove-keywords.sh
```

### Manual Fix
For each of the 91 HTML files, delete the line containing:
```html
<meta name="keywords" content="...">
```

Typically found at line 10 in most files, between the meta description and robots meta tag.

### Verification
```bash
# Should return 0 results
grep -c 'meta name="keywords"' *.html
```
