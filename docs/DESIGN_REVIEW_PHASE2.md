# Design Review Report: Phase 2 Town-Specific Landing Pages

**Project:** R&E Roofing Website
**Review Date:** September 30, 2025
**Reviewer:** Design Director
**Status:** PENDING - PAGES NOT YET CREATED

---

## Executive Summary

**VERDICT: UNABLE TO REVIEW - PHASE 2 PAGES DO NOT EXIST**

Phase 2 town-specific landing pages have not been created yet. The frontend-developer has not completed the work required for this design review. This report documents the current state and provides a comprehensive review framework for when the pages are created.

---

## Current Project State

### What Exists
- **Homepage (index.html)**: Complete with hero, services, navigation
- **Services Page (services.html)**: Exists but needs content verification
- **Core Pages**: about.html, reviews.html, calculator.html, faq.html, blog.html - **NOT YET CREATED**
- **Phase 2 Town Pages**: **NOT YET CREATED**

### What's Expected for Phase 2
According to `/Users/charwinvanryckdegroot/Downloads/R&E Roofing/SEO_STRATEGY.md`, Phase 2 requires creating 10 town-specific landing pages for **Essex County, NJ** (not Maryland):

**Tier 1 Towns (Priority for Phase 2):**
1. Newark, NJ
2. Montclair, NJ
3. Bloomfield, NJ
4. Irvington, NJ
5. Nutley, NJ
6. Belleville, NJ
7. Livingston, NJ
8. West Orange, NJ
9. East Orange, NJ
10. Maplewood, NJ

**NOTE:** The task description mentioned Maryland towns (Baltimore, Annapolis, Columbia, Towson, Ellicott City, Glen Burnie, Dundalk, Catonsville, Owings Mills, Severna Park), but the actual project serves Essex County, New Jersey. This discrepancy needs clarification.
