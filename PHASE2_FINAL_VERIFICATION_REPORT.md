## Integration Testing

### Homepage Integration: ❌ FAILED

**Issue:** Homepage "Areas We Serve" section (lines 349-370) still contains placeholder links pointing to "#"

**Current State:**
```html
<a href="#" class="area-link">Newark</a>
<a href="#" class="area-link">Montclair</a>
<a href="#" class="area-link">Bloomfield</a>
```

**Expected State:**
```html
<a href="roofing-newark-nj.html" class="area-link">Newark</a>
<a href="roofing-montclair-nj.html" class="area-link">Montclair</a>
<a href="roofing-bloomfield-nj.html" class="area-link">Bloomfield</a>
```

**Impact:** Users clicking these links get no navigation - broken user experience

### Required Fix:
Update `/Users/charwinvanryckdegroot/Downloads/R&E Roofing/index.html` lines 349-370 to link to actual pages for Newark, Montclair, and Bloomfield.

---

## Sitemap Status

### Current Sitemap: ❌ NOT UPDATED

The town pages are not included in `/Users/charwinvanryckdegroot/Downloads/R&E Roofing/sitemap.xml`

```xml
<url>
  <loc>https://reroofing.com/roofing-newark-nj.html</loc>
