---

## Security Considerations

- ✅ Form validation implemented client-side
- ✅ No inline JavaScript event handlers
- ✅ No hardcoded sensitive data visible
- ⚠️ Server-side validation should be implemented when forms are connected to backend

---

## Recommendations

### High Priority (None)
All critical functionality is working properly.

### Medium Priority
1. **Connect Forms to Backend** - Forms currently show success messages but don't submit data
2. **Add Form CSRF Protection** - When backend is connected
3. **Implement Rate Limiting** - For contact form and chat submissions

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
1. **Add Loading States** - Spinner while forms are submitting
2. **Implement Analytics** - Google Analytics or similar for tracking
3. **Add Error Tracking** - Sentry or similar for production error monitoring
4. **Optimize Images** - Use WebP format with fallbacks
5. **Add Service Worker** - For offline functionality and faster loads
